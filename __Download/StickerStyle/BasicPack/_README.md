### IF MENTIONING THE AUTHOR
Be careful to not mention the author in your product in a way or place that misleadingly implies a direct participation in your project (other than the mere licensing of assets) or that incorrectly attributes asset modifications to the author. For example, if giving attribution, a term like "licensed from" (referring to the original assets in an appropriate "credits" section or equivalent) can be used.

Please don't use the name of the author to endorse or promote products using these assets without permission.

See also sections 2.8, 7 and 9 of the EULA.

### IF MODIFYING ASSETS
To retain maximum quality of the images, edit the source vector files inside `Vector/src.zip`. You can open these SVG files with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/about/) or any compatible program.  
You can use Inkscape's export feature to generate PNG sprites at 256px or any other desired resolution.  
If your tools are able to use the vector image natively, you can save the spritesheet as an optimized SVG in Inkscape, generating `svg-min` (minified) or `svg-named` (includes element ids). See instructions inside src in this case.  
If you want the SVG sprites split into separate files, use the HTML page included inside src to generate `svg-split` from `svg-named`.

Thank you, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!
