# Example Scene

The "Test Sprites" example scene demonstrates usage of the assets.

You can assign a cursor on the game object `_controller`.  
Get the corresponding hotspot in the `Cursors.csv` file, which can be opened in a spreadsheet app.

You can simply delete this `_example` folder once you're done with it.


## Troubleshooting

If you get errors or warnings when playing the example, it can be due to a missing dependency:

- Unity UI: Make sure the package `com.unity.ugui` is installed, either directly or indirectly.
